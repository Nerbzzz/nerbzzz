# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Nikki

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a burning passion for technology. I'm currently diving deeper into the field through formal studies, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills.

Beyond coding, I love tinkering with all things IT. Whether it's setting up a home lab, exploring networking concepts, or delving into cybersecurity, I enjoy getting my hands dirty and figuring out how things work. There's something incredibly satisfying about building and securing systems from the ground up.
