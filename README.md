# Hey

I'm a full-stack software engineer with a deep passion for technology in a bunch of its forms. Right now, I'm running my own NixOS server and building an underwater drone in my spare time. I love experimenting with all kinds of things and as such you'll often see me making small projects with all kinds of new things.

While I enjoy programming in general, I'm especially drawn to back-end development. Designing and building robust, complex APIs is one of my favorite things to do!

A few of my favorite areas to dive into are:
- Cybersecurity
- Network management
- Server administration

Besides that, I am currently experimenting with 3D Printing, and Embedded technology.
